# Merge_Sorting
This project is a very great example for Merge Sorting algorithm. If you have a little bit of programming knowledge, you can write this code in any programming language. also I explained how this code works.
# How does it work?
first of all we make a heap from our unsorted array but we do not change the array cuz the main point of this algorithm is do not use mem and do inline sorting, so we simulate
the heap index with left() and right() method.
in Max Heap there is an attribute, root(s) is(are) equalse or less then parent, so we should applay this property to our heap.
now we can extend this attribute to all of the heap.
and at last we convert our sorted heap to a line via take out the Max element till end.
# Time:
<u><i>T = U+03B8(nlgn) </i></u>

(n is number of elements and T is not necessarily seconds)

# How can we test it?

That's so simple! there is a tester file you can use!
