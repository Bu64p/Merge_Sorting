# Merge_Sorting
This project is a very great example for Merge Sorting algorithm. If you have a little bit of programming knowledge, you can write this code in any programming language. also I explained how this code works.
# How does it work?
This algorithm is really easy! we divide array till we have an array with 1 element and naturally one element, is sorted. so we merge sorted array to each other till all of element get sorted.
also in merge part, we dont need to use any loop, we use recursion to merge 2 one element arrays to 1 two element array and ...
# Time:
<u><i>T = Î¸(nlgn) </i></u>

(n is number of elements and T is not necessarily seconds)

# How can we test it?

That's so simple! there is a tester file you can use!
